Steiner Tree

The aim of this project is to solve the Steiner tree problem using various methods from the field of operations research. I am using multiple instances (located in the "Istanze" directory) to compare the algorithms that have been developed. The methods I have tried include:

Greedy (including the Shortest Path heuristic)
Local Search
GRASP
Simulated Annealing
Tabu Search
